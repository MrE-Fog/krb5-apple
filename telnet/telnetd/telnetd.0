NAME
     telnetd - DARPA TELNET protocol server

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/telnetd [-debug [_p_o_r_t]] [-l] [-D options]  [-D  report]
     [-D exercise] [-D netdata]	[-D ptydata]

DESCRIPTION
     _T_e_l_n_e_t_d is	a server which supports	the DARPA standard TELNET
     virtual terminal protocol.	 _T_e_l_n_e_t_d is invoked by the inter-
     net server	(see _i_n_e_t_d(8)),	normally for requests to  connect
     to	 the  TELNET  port as indicated	by the /_e_t_c/_s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s file
     (see _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s(5)).	 If the	-debug may be used, to	start  up
     telnetd  manually,	 instead of through _i_n_e_t_d(8).  If started
     up	this way, _p_o_r_t may be specified	 to  run  _t_e_l_n_e_t_d  on  an
     alternate TCP port	number.

     The -D option may be  used	 for  debugging	 purposes.   This
     allows _t_e_l_n_e_t to print out	debugging information to the con-
     nection, allowing the user	to see	what  telnetd  is  doing.
     There  are	 several  modifiers:  options  prints information
     about the negotiation of TELNET options, report  prints  the
     options  information, plus	some additional	information about
     what processing is	 going	on,  netdata  displays	the  data
     stream received by	_t_e_l_n_e_t_d, ptydata displays data written to
     the pty, and exercise has not been	implemented yet.

     _T_e_l_n_e_t_d operates by allocating a pseudo-terminal device (see
     _p_t_y(4))  for  a  client, then creating a login process which
     has the slave side	of the pseudo-terminal as stdin,  stdout,
     and  stderr.   _T_e_l_n_e_t_d  manipulates  the  master side of the
     pseudo-terminal, implementing the TELNET protocol and  pass-
     ing  characters between the remote	client and the login pro-
     cess.

     When a TELNET session is started up,  _t_e_l_n_e_t_d  sends  TELNET
     options  to  the  client side indicating a	willingness to do
     _r_e_m_o_t_e _e_c_h_o of characters,	 to  _s_u_p_p_r_e_s_s  _g_o  _a_h_e_a_d,  to  do
     _r_e_m_o_t_e  _f_l_o_w  _c_o_n_t_r_o_l, and	to receive _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l _t_y_p_e _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_-
     _t_i_o_n, _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l _s_p_e_e_d _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n, and _w_i_n_d_o_w  _s_i_z_e	 _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_-
     _t_i_o_n  from	 the remote client.  If	the remote client is wil-
     ling, the remote terminal type is propagated in the environ-
     ment  of  the  created  login  process.  The pseudo-terminal
     allocated to the client is	configured to operate in "cooked"
     mode, and with XTABS and CRMOD enabled (see _t_t_y(4)).

     _T_e_l_n_e_t_d is	willing	to _d_o: _e_c_h_o, _b_i_n_a_r_y, _s_u_p_p_r_e_s_s  _g_o  _a_h_e_a_d,
     and  _t_i_m_i_n_g  _m_a_r_k.	  _T_e_l_n_e_t_d  is  willing to have the remote
     client _d_o:	_l_i_n_e_m_o_d_e, _b_i_n_a_r_y, _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l _t_y_p_e, _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l  _s_p_e_e_d,
     _w_i_n_d_o_w  _s_i_z_e,  _t_o_g_g_l_e  _f_l_o_w  _c_o_n_t_r_o_l, _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t,	_X _d_i_s_p_l_a_y
     _l_o_c_a_t_i_o_n, and _s_u_p_p_r_e_s_s _g_o _a_h_e_a_d.

BUGS
     Some TELNET commands are only partially implemented.

     Because of	bugs in	the original 4.2 BSD  _t_e_l_n_e_t(1),  _t_e_l_n_e_t_d
     performs  some dubious protocol exchanges to try to discover
     if	the remote client is, in fact, a 4.2 BSD _t_e_l_n_e_t(1).

     _B_i_n_a_r_y _m_o_d_e has  no  common  interpretation  except  between
     similar operating systems (Unix in	this case).

     The terminal type name received from the  remote  client  is
     converted to lower	case.

     _T_e_l_n_e_t_d never sends TELNET	_g_o _a_h_e_a_d commands.
