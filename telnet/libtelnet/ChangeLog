Sat Apr 22 00:50:14 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* kerberos5.c (kerberos5_init): Only call krb5_init_context if 
		the telnet context hasn't been initialized yet.

Thu Apr 20 20:12:32 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	Changes for testsuite from Ian Taylor <ian@cygnus.com>
	* kerberos5.c (telnet_srvtab): New global variable.
	(telnet_krb5_realm): New global variable.
	(kerberos5_send): If telnet_krb5_realm is set, copy it into
	creds.server.  Pass new_creds to krb5_mk_req_extended, not &creds.
	Pass &new_creds->keyblock to krb5_copy_keyblock_contents, not
	new_creds.
	(kerberos5_is): pass telnet_srvtab in to krb_rd_req.
	(kerberos5_forward): If telnet_krb5_realm is set, copy it into
	local_creds->server.

Wed Mar 29 15:08:43 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* kerberos5.c: No need to have the session_key established for
		mutual authentication to work.  (That's only done if
		ENCRYPTION is defined.)

	* auth.c (authenticators): Allow mutual authentication even if the
		ENCRYPTION option is not turned on.

Mon Mar 27 07:56:26 1995 Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

        * kerberos5.c (kerberos5_is()): Use new calling convention for 
		krb5_rd_req(), and krb5_mk_rep().

Fri Mar 24 23:51:18 1995  Theodore Y. Ts'o  <tytso@dcl>

	* kerberos5.c (kerberos5_send): Initialize auth_context to zero
		before calling mk_req.

Fri Mar 10 11:09:34 1995  Chris Provenzano (proven@mit.edu)

        * kerberos5.c: Use new calling convention for krb5_mk_req_extended().

Tue Mar  7 19:52:00 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: take out ISODE_DEFS, ISODE_INCLUDE.

Tue Feb 28 01:48:32 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* forward.c, kerberos5.c:  Avoid <krb5/...> includes.

Tue Feb 14 15:30:55 1995 Chris Provenzano  (proven@mit.edu)

        * kerberos5.c (kerberos5_send(), kerberos5_forward()) 
		Call krb5_get_credentials() and krb5_mk_req_extended() 
		with new calling convention.

Thu Feb  2 02:56:50 1995  John Gilmore  <gnu@cygnus.com>

	* forward.c:  Remove unused #include <krb5/crc-32.h>.
	* kerberos5.c (kerberos5_send):  Remove code for sending a checksum
	of a zero-byte string; we can just send no checksum at all.  This
	eliminates dependency on <krb5/crc-32.h>.
	(kerberos5_forward):  Remove extra parameter to krb5_get_for_creds,
	probably accidentally inserted during context changes -- which don't
	seem to be here in the ChangeLog.
	* kerberos.c:  Remove prototypes for krb4 functions, since
	some of them are wrong with CNS (u_long vs. KRB_INT32 conflicts).

Fri Nov 18 15:19:26 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* kerberos5.c (kerberos5_init): Initialize magic variable and
		encryption type.  

Fri Nov 18 00:37:13 1994  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: use WITH_KRB4. (from epeisach)

Mon Nov 14 16:27:29 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* kerberos.c (kerberos4_is): Initialize random number generator on
		the server side so that the encryption routines later on
		can use it. 

	* kerberos.c (kerberos4_send): Fix bug in how we pick the
		challenge for the challenge/response mutual
		authentication.

Fri Nov 11 00:55:36 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* forward.c (mk_cred, rd_cred): Move these routines to libkrb.a.

Tue Nov  8 01:39:50 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* kerberos.c (kerberos4_is): Fix bug in logic of incrementing the
		received challenge.  A ++/-- mixup means there's a 1 in
		256 chance the server will get it wrong.

	* kerberos.c: Use des_init_random_number_genator(), since that
		will result in different subsession keys on successive
		runs of telnet.

Mon Nov  7 22:36:20 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@dcl)

	* auth.c (auth_status): Only print each possible authentication
		type once in the status report.

	* auth.c (auth_onoff): Remove excess call to getauthmask() which
		stomped the mask field.  Only print each possible
		authentication type once in the help message.

	* auth.c (getauthmask): Fix reversed sense of strcasecmp
		comparison.

	* auth.c (auth_enable, auth_disable): Change the input type to be
		a char *, which is what auth_onoff wants anyway.

Mon Aug  8 22:16:54 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso at tsx-11)

	* kerberos5.c (kerberos5_send): Whoops, mispelled
	krb5_copy_keyblock_contents().  (It was inside #ifdef
	ENCRYPTION)

Thu Aug  4 03:36:29 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in: add blank target for install

Tue Jul 26 18:21:29 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in: whoops left out some $(srcdir) stuff

Mon Jul 25 01:05:31 1994  Tom Yu  (tlyu@dragons-lair)

	* Makefile.in: remove reference to lorder (linux doesn't have
	lorder, it seems)

Fri Jul 15 23:36:50 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso at tsx-11)

	* kerberos5.c (kerberos5_is): Avoid coredump caused by freeing of
	an unitialized variable.  Also make sure we don't try to free name
	if it is NULL.
