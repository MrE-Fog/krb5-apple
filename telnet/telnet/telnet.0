protocol The command is	used to	 communicate  with  another  host
using  the  protocol.	If  is	invoked	 without the argument, it
enters command mode, indicated by its prompt  In  this	mode,  it
accepts	and executes the commands listed below.	 If it is invoked
with arguments,	it performs  an	 command  with	those  arguments.
Options:  Use an eight bit data	path.  This will cause an attempt
to negotiate the BINARY	option on both	input  and  output.   The
option	stops  any  character  from being recognized as	an escape
character.  Do not attempt to do automatic login  to  the  remote
system.	  Use  an eight	bit data path on output.  This causes the
BINARY option to be negotiated on output.  Disable  the	 type  of
authentication.	  Attempt automatic login.  Currently, this sends
the user name via the USER variable of the ENVIRON option if sup-
ported	by  the	 remote	 system.   The	name  used is that of the
current	user as	returned by if it agrees with  the  current  user
ID,  otherwise	it  is the name	associated with	the user ID.  The
flag disables the reading of the users (See the	 command  below.)

name, an alias,	or the Internet	address	of a remote host.   Indi-
cates  a  port	number (address	of an application) or name.  If	a
number is not specified, the default port is  used.   Port  names
are  mapped to port numbers via	the /etc/services file.	 Normally
when a port number is specified, will not send	out  any  initial
option	negotiation.   If  the	port number/name is preceded by	a
minus sign, then the initial option  negotiation  will	be  sent.
When  in  mode,	 a  line  of the form ``~.'' disconnects from the
remote host, where ``~'' is the	escape character.  Similarly, the
line  ``~^Z''  will  suspend  the session.  The	line ``~^]'' will
escape to the normal escape prompt.  Once a connection	has  been
opened,	 will  attempt to enable the option.  If this fails, then
will revert to one of two input	modes: either character	at a time
or old line by line depending on what the remote system	supports.
When is	enabled, character processing is done on the  local  sys-
tem,  under the	control	of the remote system.  When input editing
or character echoing is	to be disabled,	the  remote  system  will
relay  that  information.   The	 remote	 system	 will  also relay
changes	to any special characters that happen on the remote  sys-
tem,  so that they can take effect on the local	system.	 In char-
acter at a time	mode, most text	typed is immediately sent to  the
remote	host  for processing.  In old line by line mode, all text
is echoed locally, and (normally) only completed lines	are  sent
to  the	remote host.  The local	echo character (initially ^E) may
be used	to turn	off and	on the local echo (this	would  mostly  be
used  to  enter	passwords without the password being echoed).  If
the option is enabled, or if the toggle	is TRUE	(the default  for
old  line  by  line;  see  below),  the	user's and characters are
trapped	locally, and sent as protocol  sequences  to  the  remote
side.	If  has	 ever  been enabled, then the user's and are also
sent as	protocol sequences, and	is sent	as a instead of	There are

by  typing  the	escape character (initially ^ ).  When in command
mode, the normal terminal editing conventions are available.  The
following commands are available.  Only	enough of each command to
uniquely identify it need be typed (this is also true for most of
the  arguments	to the commands).  The command is used to manipu-
late the the information that my be sent through the option.

used.
